# NodeSchool

[NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) is a platofrm that contains open source workshops that teach software skills which I have used as a learning tool primarily towards my understanding of Node.

*"NodeSchool is an open source project run by volunteers with two goals: to create high quality programming curriculum and to host community learning events."*

Each of the completed tasks for the workshops have been placed in the folders titled and detailed below.

## Core
These workshoppers focus on essential skills for working with Node.js.

### javascripting
I have used this workshop to help me learn some of the basic concepts of JavaScript by adventuring around in the terminal.
